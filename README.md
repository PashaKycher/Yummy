🍰 Yummy

Yummy is a simple one-page website dedicated to delicious desserts and sweets.
This project was created during my early learning stage to practice HTML and CSS fundamentals — layout building, typography, color combinations, and responsive elements.

🌟 Features

Clean and minimal one-page design

Section-based structure (hero, product showcase, about, and contact)

Semantic HTML layout for better readability

Custom styling with pure CSS (no frameworks used)

Organized CSS files by section for clarity and easy maintenance

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5 – page structure and semantic markup

CSS3 – visual styling, layout, and responsiveness

Google Fonts – typography enhancement (if used)

Images & icons – for branding and product visuals
